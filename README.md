### Abstract

Locomotion is a fundamental interaction in Virtual Reality (VR).
Current locomotion methods, such as redirected walking, walkingin-place, and teleportation, make use of limited physical space and
interaction mapping. However, there remains significant potential
for improvement, particularly in reducing equipment burden and
enhancing immersion. To locate these limitations, we rethink the
procedure of VR walking interaction through the Human Information Processing paradigm. Finding that the peripherals’ requirements and potential conflict in artificially designed interaction mappings are the bottlenecks in bridging intention and action, we developed MyGO, an AI-assisted locomotion prediction method. MyGO
predicts users’ future trajectories from their subtle movements, collected only by a VR headset, using a multitask learning (MTL)
model. The proposed model demonstrates competitive results in
both dataset validation and real-time studies
